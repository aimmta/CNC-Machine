# Mechanical Leveling and Squaring

Axis naming follows industry-standard CNC convention: X is long-table travel, Y is gantry crossbeam travel, and Z is vertical.

## Leveling

Use the adjusters in the legs of the table to bring the top of the table into level. Use a 4' spirit level to check in both the X and Y axis at various pints along the table.
