# Readme

If you're the sort of person that likes to vomit $10,000 into a trash can and set it ablaze, ignore all of this and follow your gut.

If you want you machine to work, read the reference material and follow the instructions.

## Reference Materials

1. [3 Axis Table and Gantry System Configuration - V1](<https://cad.onshape.com/documents/532da8b92839cfa5dca263e4/w/8d17c162fe461645cd47aa79/e/e7ad9d5bf361f626c0b211c2>)
1. [Power and Control System Configuration - V1](<System Configuration.md>)
1. [Wiring Shopping List](<Wiring Shopping List.md>)

## Build and Commissioning Order (Authoritative)

[Build Order Dependency Chart](<Build Order Dependency Chart.md>)

All setup, configuration, and commissioning steps must follow this order.  
Mechanical and electrical systems are interdependent and must be validated at their defined gates.
